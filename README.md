# Tohka Mirai CNC Exploitation framework V.1 - By Lore<3

## ❓ About:
Tohka is a Mirai CNC exploitation framework written in python. 
It contains modules and basic exploits that can be used to take over, 
crash, and flood a Mirai CNC server and its MySQL server. 

Due to how basic the security these Mirai CNC servers have,
this exploitation framework makes abusing this low level security
very easy.


- Many more modules and exploits to come!
